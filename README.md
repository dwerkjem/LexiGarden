# LexiGarden

## Description

LexiGarden is a gamified application designed to make learning new words engaging and fun. By turning vocabulary expansion into a game, users earn points, unlock achievements, and visually track their progress through a virtual garden that grows with their knowledge. This approach aims to overcome the challenges of traditional vocabulary learning methods, making it an exciting journey rather than a tedious task.
