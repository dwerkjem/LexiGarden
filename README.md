# LexiGarden

## Description

LexiGarden is a gamified application designed to make learning new words engaging and fun. By turning vocabulary expansion into a game, users earn points, unlock achievements, and visually track their progress and their knowledge. This approach aims to overcome the challenges of traditional vocabulary learning methods, making it an exciting journey rather than a tedious task.

## Installation

execute the following commands in the root directory of the project:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

add a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content (replace `your_openai_api_key` with your OpenAI API key):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

if you need a new OpenAI API key, you can create one [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
